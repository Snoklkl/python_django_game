Overview: Stock trading game

Details: Webpage that allows user to engage in a fictional trading of stocks. Stocks can be bought and sold, tracked in value over the course of the year the player plays in the form of a graph, and will be assessed along with the player's cash to determine if the player has lost at certain intervals.

Technologies: Python, Mysqlite, Django, Ajax

Ideas for the future: 
- Allow for the user to input what year they want to play in, which will then be used to request the stock data from quandl.
- Allow for the user to choose what stocks they would like to play with, at the moment there are only three stocks in game and they are static.
- Add a "news" section that would give recent news in the context of the timeline the player is playing in, letting them see real stories that occured to these 
companies as a means of evaluating which assests seem like they will garner more or less value.
